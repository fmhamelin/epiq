**Title.** Deterministic and Stochastic Models for the Spread of
 Disease in Competing Species

**Abstract.** We present models for competing species that are both affected by a single pathogen. Using the Barley/Cereal Yellow Dwarf (B/CYDV) virus suite as a case study, we discuss the interaction of disease and competitive dynamics in a deterministic patch model to understand how spatial heterogeneity contributes to changes in the competitive dynamics of two plant species. Using a simpler non-spatial model we then address how demographic stochasticity contributes to additional changes in the competitive dynamics of two species affected by a single pathogen. This is joint work with Linda Allen, Elizabeth Borer, Carrie Manore, Sean Moore and Parviez Hosseini.
