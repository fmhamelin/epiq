**Title.** Whitefly-borne cassava viruses and the estimation of viral retention period from access period experiments

**Abstract.** In recent decades, a cassava mosaic begomovirus  epidemic (CMV) spread by *Bemisia tabaci* whitefly has  severely affected cassava yield in sub-Saharan Africa, and this was followed by a regional cassava brown streak ipomovirus epidemic (CBSV) spread by the same vector. For CMV and CBSV, and for plant viruses more generally, estimation of the duration that a pathogen is retained in an insect vector - i.e., viral retention period - is important for understanding plant virus epidemiology. This is typically investigated in access period experiments in which the duration of access of insects to plants is experimentally varied. In this presentation I will discuss new modelling for estimation of viral retention period from access period experiments in relation to CBSV and CMV.
