**Title.** Analyzing the trajectories of soil pathogens to identify attraction potentials

**Absract.** At the *Insitut de Physique de Nice*, we are interested in an oomycete zoospore, both from the point of view of the physics of individual or collective swimming, and from the biological point of view, in particular concerning interactions with the root. Our study model is the Arabidopsis thaliana plant infected by Phytophthora parasitica. I will present some results regarding the kinetics of zoospores interacting with the root in experiments using microfluidic systems.
I will then present an approach in which we will attempt to develop a tool allowing us to map an attraction potential based on the trajectories of zoospores.
