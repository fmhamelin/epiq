**Title.** Mountain pine beetle management in Canada

**Abstract.** The mountain pine beetle (MPB) is a bark beetle that infests and kills various species of pines. During an epidemic, MPB individuals coordinate their attacks, using aggregation pheromones, to form a "mass attack" and overwhelm the defences of large and healthy trees presenting a threat to healthy pine stands. Since 2000, the MPB epidemic has caused extensive  mortality in Canadian pine forests, which is in conflict with human objectives in many places. To better control MPB populations, we need to investigate and assess MPB management.  

In this talk, I will, first, present the assessment of the current detection strategy while taking management costs into account.  

Second, I will present a way to introduce management in population dynamic models through the use of functional responses.
