**Title.** Epidemics of fungal diseases of wheat across spatial scales

**Abstract.** I will overview my recent research in plant disease epidemiology and pathogen evolution. A particular focus is on the two wheat diseases: septoria tritici blotch (caused by the fungus  *Zymoseptoria tritici*) and yellow rust (caused by the fungus *Puccinia striiformis*). The methodology combines mathematical modeling, experimentation in controlled environments and in the field. Management of major fungal diseases of wheat still relies largely on fungicides and cultivars with major disease resistance genes. Both of these control measures are vulnerable to pathogen adaptation, especially for the two pathogens of interest that are capable of maintaining large and diverse populations populations [1]. One of the key applied goals of my research is to devise a more  integrated approach to disease management that impedes pathogen adaptation and leads to a more sustainable crop protection. This approach should combine several control measures and optimize their deployment across spatial scales from canopies to fields to landscapes. Of particular importance will be measures that do not impose selection for pathogen adaptation, such as disease tolerant plants [2], or measures that reduce selection for pathogen adaptation, such as cultivar mixtures [3,4]. To achieve this goal, we need to be able to measure wheat diseases across large areas in a rapid and accurate manner. Technological advances in artificial intelligence applied to digital image analysis  [5] and proximal/remote sensing [6] offer a promising path forward. However, to improve disease management, large imaging and sensing datasets need to be analyzed through the lens of process-based mathematical modeling.
