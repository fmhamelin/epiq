**Title.** Mathematical models of a  social-ecological system: coupling lake pollution dynamics and human behavior

**Abstract.** From global warming over land-use change to pollution, the world is facing many environmental problems. While the causes are relatively well-known from a natural sciences point of view, the challenge is the implementation of potential
 solutions. Societal demands, human behavior, and economic aspects not only impact the environmental state, but are reversely affected by the environment.  

In this talk, I will introduce a mathematical model that is deliberately simplified to better understand the mutual feedbacks in a coupled human-environment system. The model consists of an "ecological" part that describes the eutrophication of shallow lakes and a "social" part that desribes human behavior in the discharge of nutrients causing eutrophication. The latter uses approaches from evolutionary game theory. Both parts can exhibit tipping points, where the lake water abruptly shifts from a clear to a turbid state, or where human behavior shifts from high to low pollution activities. Mathematically, the model is composed of two nonlinear differential equations; we find up to four coexisting attractors, limit cycle oscillations, and evidence for Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations.  

Due to the interaction between tipping point dynamics, policy interventions that may be useful in one context need not be useful in another. Thus, it seems impossible to derive a general rule of thumb for how to achieve a desirable state. Nevertheless, knowing the dynamics of a system in question can help comparing management strategies and preventing undesired consequences.
