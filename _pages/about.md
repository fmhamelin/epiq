Our working group brings together quantitative plant disease epidemiologists from the [Institute of Genetics, Environment and Plant Protection](https://www6.rennes.inrae.fr/igepp_eng/), France. We study of the spread of plant pathogens, their vectors and pests at the field or landscape scale, by mobilizing the resources of modeling, experimentation and data exploitation. 

This website is under construction. It will list the webinars organized by the working group, ongoing projects, publications, online applications, and opportunities for students and postdocs.
